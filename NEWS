===================
1.3.0 - May 8, 2019
===================

- Do not include EGL headers in libwpe public headers.
- New API for exported images which allows querying their dimension their
  backing EGLImageKHR.
- Use the default priority for the GLib event sources.

=========================
1.1.0 - December 14, 2018
=========================

- Use the new libwpe API to notify when frames have been displayed.
- Allow calling wpe_fdo_initialize_for_egl_display() multiple times, with
  a warning printed to the standard error output when trying to switch
  displays (which is unsupported).
- Provide a dummy implementation of the EGL offscreen target interface, to
  let WebKit use Pbuffer-based offscreen contexts as fallback, instead of
  crashing.
- Minor cleanups in headers and function prototypes.

=======================
1.0.0 - August 21, 2018
=======================

- Updated to use libwpe 1.0.0.
- The libWPEBackend-fdo library now uses the libtool versioning convention.
- New API which supports exporting frames as EGL images. This provides
  applications with a ready to to render EGLImage, and has the advantage
  that the library hides the actual protocol used by the backend's nested
  compositor from the application.
- Improved dispatching of Wayland events.
- Support using DMA-BUF Wayland surfaces.
- Support using Wayland versions older than 1.10

====================
0.1 - April 26, 2018
====================

- Initial release
