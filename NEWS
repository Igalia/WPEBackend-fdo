====================
1.8.4 - May 12, 2021
====================

- Fixed frozen web views not being updated after PSON when multiple web
  views (and hence view backends) are in use.
- Fixed invalid usage of Wayland client connections in the nested compositor
  which caused crashes in some situations.

======================
1.8.3 - March 30, 2021
======================

- Fixed UI process getting stuck when navigating across different security
  origins. This also fixed a small memory leak.

======================
1.8.2 - March 18, 2021
======================

- Fixed headers to include <wpe/wpe.h> from the top-level API headers,
  as their consumers expect the public libwpe API to be defined as well.

======================
1.8.1 - March 18, 2021
======================

- Fixed headers to include <wpe/wpe.h> from the top-level API headers,
  as their consumers expect the public libwpe API to be defined as well.

======================
1.8.1 - March 10, 2021
======================

- Fixed invalid usage of Wayland client connections in the nested compositor
  which caused sporadic crashes in certain conditions.
- Fixed a file descriptor leak on view backend initialization.
- Fixed a small memory leak when releasing exportable view backends.

==========================
1.8.0 - September 11, 2020
==========================

- This release does not contain changes over the 1.7.90 development release

==========================
1.7.90 - September 4, 2020
==========================

- This release does not contain changes over the 1.7.1 development release

=====================
1.7.1 - July 29, 2020
=====================

- Added new API for the audio rendering protocol, which allows embedders to
  receive audio samples instead of letting WPE WebKit handle their playback.
- Added support to export frames using EGLStreams, which can be used e.g.
  with Nvidia GPUs.
- New build configuration system based on Meson. The existing CMake-based
  system is still maintained, and both produce the same outputs.
- Expose symbols for the version retrieval functions.
- Use libepoxy for EGL operations.

=====================
1.3.1 - June 13, 2019
=====================

- New macros in the API to check the version at compilation time.
- Added support for detaching and attaching new ones for a view backend.
- Improved handling of Wayland events.
- Improved how CMake searches for wayland-scanner, making it friendlier for
  cross-compilation.
- Fixed double-free of callback resources during destruction of view backends.

===================
1.3.0 - May 8, 2019
===================

- Do not include EGL headers in libwpe public headers.
- New API for exported images which allows querying their dimension their
  backing EGLImageKHR.
- Use the default priority for the GLib event sources.

=========================
1.1.0 - December 14, 2018
=========================

- Use the new libwpe API to notify when frames have been displayed.
- Allow calling wpe_fdo_initialize_for_egl_display() multiple times, with
  a warning printed to the standard error output when trying to switch
  displays (which is unsupported).
- Provide a dummy implementation of the EGL offscreen target interface, to
  let WebKit use Pbuffer-based offscreen contexts as fallback, instead of
  crashing.
- Minor cleanups in headers and function prototypes.

=======================
1.0.0 - August 21, 2018
=======================

- Updated to use libwpe 1.0.0.
- The libWPEBackend-fdo library now uses the libtool versioning convention.
- New API which supports exporting frames as EGL images. This provides
  applications with a ready to to render EGLImage, and has the advantage
  that the library hides the actual protocol used by the backend's nested
  compositor from the application.
- Improved dispatching of Wayland events.
- Support using DMA-BUF Wayland surfaces.
- Support using Wayland versions older than 1.10

====================
0.1 - April 26, 2018
====================

- Initial release
