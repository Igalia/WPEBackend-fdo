==========================
1.4.0 - September 18, 2019
==========================

- Fix the build with CMake 3.11 and older.

==========================
1.3.91 - September 9, 2019
==========================

- Support DMA-BUF resource exports through a new callback in the API.
- Improve management and cleanup of Wayland resources.
- Make the build more reliable using CMake imported library targets.
- Enable compiler warnings.

=====================
1.3.1 - June 13, 2019
=====================

- New macros in the API to check the version at compilation time.
- Added support for detaching and attaching new ones for a view backend.
- Improved handling of Wayland events.
- Improved how CMake searches for wayland-scanner, making it friendlier for
  cross-compilation.
- Fixed double-free of callback resources during destruction of view backends.

===================
1.3.0 - May 8, 2019
===================

- Do not include EGL headers in libwpe public headers.
- New API for exported images which allows querying their dimension their
  backing EGLImageKHR.
- Use the default priority for the GLib event sources.

=========================
1.1.0 - December 14, 2018
=========================

- Use the new libwpe API to notify when frames have been displayed.
- Allow calling wpe_fdo_initialize_for_egl_display() multiple times, with
  a warning printed to the standard error output when trying to switch
  displays (which is unsupported).
- Provide a dummy implementation of the EGL offscreen target interface, to
  let WebKit use Pbuffer-based offscreen contexts as fallback, instead of
  crashing.
- Minor cleanups in headers and function prototypes.

=======================
1.0.0 - August 21, 2018
=======================

- Updated to use libwpe 1.0.0.
- The libWPEBackend-fdo library now uses the libtool versioning convention.
- New API which supports exporting frames as EGL images. This provides
  applications with a ready to to render EGLImage, and has the advantage
  that the library hides the actual protocol used by the backend's nested
  compositor from the application.
- Improved dispatching of Wayland events.
- Support using DMA-BUF Wayland surfaces.
- Support using Wayland versions older than 1.10

====================
0.1 - April 26, 2018
